  <h2 class="home">Background</h2>
  

  <p class="home">The Urban Displacement Project defines gentrification as a process of neighborhood change that includes economic change in a historically disinvested neighborhood. This change could occur by means of real estate investment and new higher-income residents moving in-as well as demographic change. Demographic change can include income level, but also changes in the education level or racial make-up of residents. In other words, gentrification is the process of wealthy people populating poor neighborhoods, driving the cost of living up and ultimately causing forced displacement of the area's previous inhabitants. This pages serves as a homepage for our project which explores the trends in the Town of Davidson and Mecklenburg County. As members of the Davidson Community, we are interested about these issues here and curious to uncover new knowledge about the town we live in. Use the buttons below to navigate to visualizations which explore these trends. </p>
 
  <h2 class="home">Our Data</h2>
  <p class="home">Our data is compiled and constructed by the Data USA. Specifically we used from the Housing section of the Davidson, NC and Mecklenburg County pages specifically focused on Household Income.</p>

      How do we measure gentrification?
  </h2>
  <p class="home">
      How to best measure and identify gentrification is widely contested among researchers. Changes in percent college-educated, racial demographics, household income, and median gross rent are only a few of the many potential hints of gentrification occurring in a region. Tracing simultaneous changes in community household income and county household income is especially useful. If over time the household income of a town steadily rises at a much faster rate than the county it exists within, there may be gentrification taking place.  This idea makes sense, since if an increase in wealth in a town occurred because of more opportunities for people already living in the town, we'd expect such changes to also be reflected in the larger community (assuming the wealth of neighboring communities is relatively consistent). However, if those changes are not reflected in the larger community, it is possible that outsiders are entering the community, driving up the cost of living, and driving out the original community members.
